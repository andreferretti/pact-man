## What is Pact-Man?

Pact-Man is an AI-powered negotiation game. You play as a **Startup Founder** seeking Series A funding, while an **AI VC investor agent** (powered by GPT 5.4 via OpenRouter) negotiates back. Both sides are trying to maximize their score across 5 deal terms — but your score sheets are different, so you'll need to figure out where to push and where to concede.

The investment amount is fixed at **$100M** — what you're negotiating is everything else.

## Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Scoring

Each term has discrete options worth different points to each side. Both parties have a **BATNA (walk-away threshold) of 30 points** — if your final score is below that, you're better off with no deal.

Some options are **No Deal** for one side, meaning the other party will never accept them.

## VC Negotiation Styles

Before starting, you choose how the AI VC negotiates:

- **Collaborative** — Partnership-oriented. Explores tradeoffs, suggests package deals, makes first concessions to build goodwill. Frames everything as joint problem-solving.
- **Aggressive** — Tough and demanding. Anchors with aggressive terms, makes small reluctant concessions, uses leverage like deal flow and market risk. Holds firm under pushback.
- **Charming** — Charismatic dealmaker. Uses humor, portfolio stories, and rapport to influence. Makes concessions feel like personal gestures and deflects tough demands with warmth before countering.

## The AI Judge

After every message exchange, a separate **AI judge** (GPT 5.4, using tool calls) reads the full conversation and extracts the current state of each term — what each side has proposed, and whether there's a tentative agreement. This keeps the Deal Tracker sidebar in sync with the conversation without relying on the VC agent to self-report accurately.

## Stack

- **Frontend:** Plain HTML/CSS/JS — no framework, no build step
- **Backend:** Vercel serverless function (Node.js) — the VC agent and judge live in `api/`
- **LLM:** GPT 5.4 (VC agent + judge) via OpenRouter
- **Deploy:** Vercel

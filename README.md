## What is Pact-Man?

An AI-powered negotiation game. You're an aerospace startup founder negotiating a $100M Series A investment with an AI VC agent. You both score points on 5 deal terms (equity %, board seats, etc.), but your score sheets are different, so the game is figuring out where to push and where to give.

## Run Locally

⚠️ Before running, create a `.env` file in the project root with your [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) API key (or rename the existing `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your key):
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-key-here
STATE_SECRET=any-random-string-here
```

`STATE_SECRET` is used to HMAC-sign negotiation state so clients can't tamper with it. In local dev a fallback is used, but **set a strong secret in production** (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`).

Once the API keys are set up, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it! The project opens automatically at `http://localhost:3000`.

To run unit tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Tests run on GitHub Actions automatically on push/PR to main.

## Scoring

Each one of the 5 negotiation terms has options worth different points to each side. Both parties have a BATNA (walk-away threshold) of 30 points — if your final score is below that, you're better off with no deal.

Some options are "No Deal", meaning that you (or the VC) should never accept them. See the table below:

### VC Score Sheet

The AI-powered VC agent has its own secret scoring — the points are different from yours, which is what makes the negotiation interesting. Click the expandable box below to view it anyways:

## VC Negotiation Styles

Before starting, you choose how the AI VC negotiates:

- **Collaborative** — Partnership-oriented. Explores tradeoffs, suggests package deals, makes first concessions to build goodwill. Frames everything as joint problem-solving.
- **Aggressive** — Tough and demanding. Anchors with aggressive terms, makes small reluctant concessions, uses leverage by mentioning deal flow and market risk. Holds firm under pushback.
- **Charming** — Charismatic dealmaker. Uses humor, portfolio stories, and rapport to influence you. Makes concessions feel like personal gestures and deflects tough demands with warmth before countering.

## The AI Judge

A separate AI judge (Claude Sonnet 4.6) watches the full conversation and keeps the Deal Tracker sidebar in sync — after every exchange, it figures out what each side has proposed and whether there's agreement on each term.

## Benchmark

The `benchmark/` directory contains an AI-vs-AI simulation mode where a second LLM plays the Founder against the VC agent. It's useful for testing negotiation behavior across styles without manually typing in text as the Founder. Access it at `http://localhost:3000/benchmark/` when running locally (or at `www.pact-man.com/benchmark`).

## Stack

- **Frontend:** Plain HTML/CSS/JS — no frameworks, no build steps
- **Backend:** Vercel serverless function (Node.js) — the VC agent and judge live in `api/`
- **LLM:** Grok 4.20 (VC agent) + Claude Sonnet 4.6 (judge) called via the OpenRouter API
- **Deploy:** Vercel

Pactum Technical Challenge — Autonomous Negotiation Agent

# About Pactum

Pactum builds AI-powered autonomous negotiation software. Our platform conducts human-like negotiations on behalf of large enterprises — think of an AI that can negotiate deals with thousands of suppliers simultaneously, finding outcomes that work for both sides.

# The Challenge

Build a negotiation agent that a human can negotiate with to reach a deal.

Imagine a simple scenario: a buyer wants to purchase goods from a supplier. They need to
agree on several terms, for example:

- Price — the buyer wants to pay less, the supplier wants to earn more
- Payment terms — how many days until payment is due (e.g., Net 30, Net 60, Net 90). The buyer prefers to pay later, the supplier prefers to get paid sooner.
- Delivery time — the buyer wants faster delivery, the supplier prefers more flexibility
- Contract length — the supplier may prefer a longer commitment for stability, while the buyer may want a shorter one for flexibility

Each party has their own preferences and limits, and the interesting part is that terms can be
traded off against each other — for example, a buyer might accept a higher price in exchange
for better payment terms.

Your task is to build the buyer side as an automated negotiation agent and provide a UI where a human can play the supplier and negotiate against it. This mirrors what Pactum actually does — our AI negotiates on behalf of buyers with suppliers.

# Requirements

## Must-haves

- Negotiation engine — a back-and-forth offer/counteroffer flow between the bot (buyer) and the human (supplier)
- State management — track the negotiation state (e.g., pending, countered, accepted,rejected, expired)
- Configurable bot — the buyer bot should have configurable goals and limits (e.g., maximum acceptable price, preferred payment terms)
- At least one negotiation strategy — the bot should have logic for deciding when to accept, counter, or reject an offer
- User interface — a UI where a human can negotiate with the bot (chat-based, form-based, or any other approach)

## Nice-to-haves

- Multiple negotiation strategies that can be swapped or compared
- Analytics or visualizations of negotiation outcomes (e.g., how close to each party's ideal terms did the deal land?)
- Negotiation history / replay

# Approach

You can choose how to implement the negotiation strategy:

- Rule-based — decision trees, scoring functions, thresholds
- LLM-powered — using any available LLM API as an agent
- Hybrid — combining rules with LLM capabilities

All approaches are equally valid. We're especially interested in how you design the decision-making logic and the trade-offs behind your choice.

Hint: To evaluate and compare offers across different terms, consider using a scoring or utility function — assign weights to each term based on importance and normalize values to a common scale. This lets the agent quantify whether "lower price but slower delivery" is a better or worse deal overall.

You might also consider techniques like MESO (Multiple Equivalent Simultaneous Offers) — where the agent presents several offers at once that are equally valuable to itself but differ in how terms are distributed (e.g., "Option A: lower price but longer payment terms" vs "Option B: higher price but pay in 30 days"). This can help reveal the other party's preferences and move the negotiation forward.
